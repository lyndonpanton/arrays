# arrays
Exercise 11 for the "More C# Programming and Unity" course of the "C# Programming for Unity Game Development" Specialization by the University of Colorado via Coursera

## Description

Problem 1 - Create objects

Because you'll be using the classes in the ConsoleCards namespace from the dll I added to the project, I added a using directive for that namespace at the top of the Program.cs file.

Inside the Main method, declare a deck variable and create a new Deck object for that variable.

Inside the Main method, declare an array variable that will hold 5 cards and create a new array object for that variable.

Tell the deck to shuffle itself.

Problem 2 - Add card to the array, flip it over, and print it

Take a card from the top of the deck and add it to element 0 in the array.

Flip the card at element 0 of the array over.

Tell the card at element 0 of the array to print itself.

Problem 3 - Add another card to the array, flip it over, and print both cards

Take a card from the top of the deck and add it to element 1 in the array.

Flip the card at element 1 of the array over.

Tell the cards at elements 0 and 1 of the array to print themselves.
